New Employee Orientation
Effectively orienting new employees to the campus and to their positions is critical to establishing successful, productive working relationships. The employee's first interactions with you should create a positive impression of your department and the campus. The time you spend planning for the new person's first days and weeks on the job will greatly increase the chance for a successful start.

An effective orientation will:

- Foster an understanding of the campus culture, its values, and its diversity

- Help the new employee make a successful adjustment to the new job

- Help the new employee understand his/her role and how he/she fits into the total organization

- Help the new employee achieve objectives and shorten the learning curve

- Help the new employee develop a positive working relationship by building a foundation of knowledge about campus mission, objectives, policies, organization structure, and functions
